    // in this class we see the flow builder which is used to create the flow in kotlin.
    // there are two flow builders we use for it
    //1.asFlow()=>Transforms collections or sequences into a flow.
    //2.flowOf()=>Useful for emitting predefined values.
    //3.flow{}=>Cold asynchronous stream and Emits values sequentially in a coroutine. (we see this in basic of flow)
    //4.channelFlow{}=>Cold stream with more concurrency control and Allows sending from multiple coroutines using send().
    //5.callbackFlow{}=>Bridge callback-based APIs to Flow to Convert callback/event listeners into Flow.
    // example: - âœ… Use callbackFlow to handle Android listeners, LiveData, or any event-driven APIs.
